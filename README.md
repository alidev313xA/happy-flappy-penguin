## 📚 What I Learned

This project helped me understand and apply:

- ✅ **CSS transforms** like `rotate()`, `scale()`, and `skew()`
- ✅ **Relative positioning** using `top`, `left`, `right`, `bottom` in `%`
- ✅ **CSS animations** via `@keyframes`, `animation`, and `transform-origin`
- ✅ **Stacking elements** with `z-index` and custom layers
- ✅ **CSS Variables** for maintainable theming
- ✅ **Linear gradients** for layered backgrounds and depth

## 🧠 Bonus Concepts Applied

- CSS `:active` pseudo-selector for user interaction
- Use of `::before` for creative design extensions
- CSS transitions for smooth interactive scaling
- Responsive layout using `vh`, `vw`, and `calc()`
